# Git

A good cheat sheet on git can be found [here](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). This includes the basic commands and their function, but the ones you mostly will need are `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull` and in some cases `merge` and `checkout`.

## Merge conflicts

If you can't resolve a merge conflict, checkout a new branch (preferrably named after something relevant to the addition you tried to make), push that branch and create an issue.

Alternatively save your work separately in a different place and re-clone the repository. After this you can re-add your additons, while (hopefully) not breaking any other people's codes.

An alternative solution is to have everyone work on a separate branch and everyone manages that via pull requests, but that needs more involvement from everyones part.
